Terminology and Syntax:

Flexbox uses a one-dimensional layout model, primarily for laying out items in a single direction (row or column). You define a flex container and its child elements as flex items.
Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, allowing you to define both rows and columns explicitly. You create a grid container and place items within the grid cells.
Main Use Cases:

Flexbox is well-suited for creating flexible and dynamic layouts within a single dimension. It's great for arranging items in a row or a column, such as navigation menus, toolbars, or centering content.
Grid is designed for creating grid-based layouts, especially when you need to align elements both horizontally and vertically. It's excellent for creating complex grid structures like tables or page layouts with columns and rows.
Alignment:

Flexbox focuses on distributing space within the container along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically). You can easily control alignment, distribution, and order of flex items in this direction.
Grid allows precise control over both row and column alignment, making it ideal for creating grid-based designs with items that span multiple rows and columns.
Responsiveness:

Flexbox is great for responsive design when you need items to flex and adapt to available space in a single dimension. This is useful for creating mobile-friendly layouts, for example.
Grid is versatile in handling responsiveness by allowing items to span multiple rows and columns, making it suitable for more complex responsive designs.
Complexity:

Flexbox is generally easier to grasp and use for simpler layouts, while Grid provides more capabilities for creating intricate designs, but it may require a deeper understanding.
